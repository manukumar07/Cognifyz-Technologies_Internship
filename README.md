Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction
Objective: Introduce the concept of server-side
rendering and basic form submissions.
Steps
1.Create an HTML structure with forms for user
input.
2.Set up a simple Node.js server using Express.
Create server-side endpoints to handle form
submissions.
3.Use server-side rendering (e.g., EJS) to
dynamically generate HTML.

####
Task 2: Inline Styles, Basic Interaction, and Server-Side Validation
Objective: Expand inline styles and introduce server-side validation for form submissions.
Steps:
Extend HTML with more complex forms and user
interactions.
1.Utilize inline JavaScript for client-side form
validation.
2.Implement server-side validation for submitted
form data.
3.Store validated data in temporary server-side
storage.

#####
Task 4: Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation
Objective: Extend form validation and implement dynamic updates to the DOM.
Steps:
1.Enhance form validation to include morecomplex rules (e.g., password strength).
2.Dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions using JavaScript.
3.Implement client-side routing for a smoother user experience
